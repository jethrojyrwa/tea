            <h3>What is Tea?</h3>
            <p><dfn>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar.</dfn></p>
            
            <p>There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.</p>

            <h3>What are the health benefits of tea?</h3>
            <p>Although health benefits have been assumed throughout the history of Camellia sinensis's consumption, there is no high-quality evidence showing that tea consumption gives significant benefits other than possibly increasing alertness, an effect caused by caffeine in the tea leaves.</p>

            <p>
                Black and green teas contain no essential nutrients in significant amounts, with the exception of the dietary mineral manganese, at 0.5 mg per cup or 26% of the <abbr title='Reference Daily Intake'>RDI</abbr>.

            <h3>Indian Culture of Tea</h3>
            <p>
                India is the second largest producer of tea in the world after China, including the famous Assam tea and Darjeeling tea. Tea is the 'State Drink' of Assam.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to National Sample Survey Organisation data, India consumes 15 times more tea than coffee. Tea is made both at home and outside. Outside the home, tea is most commonly and easily found at the tea stalls that dot just about every street in India. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the British cup of tea, tea in India is not served in a set where the leaves are steeped separately. Typically, tea in India is consumed with both milk and sugar but the tea leaves are not prepared separately by being steeped. Instead, the tea leaves are boiled along with additions and then boiled again after the addition of milk and sugar. Sometimes the tea leaves themselves are used as flavouring. In many parts of the country, the most special tea is one where the tea leaves are boiled solely in milk.
